      THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED. IT HAS BEEN MERGED INTO `gedit-plugins`
         IT CAN BE INSTALLED VIA `sudo apt-get install gedit-plugins`

********************************* DEPRECATED *********************************


The multi edit plugin is inspired by the multi edit plugin developed by
Jon Walsh. This version allows you to enter a special multi edit mode in which
you can put multiple edit points into the document. Inserting or deleting text
will replicate that action at all the edit points, hence multi edit.

This plugin goes a bit further and also provides column editing. In principle,
column editing is very similar to multi edit. The difference is that you can
select a rectangular part of the buffer, which will be converted to a column
of edit points once you start inserting or deleting text. The plugin takes care
of tabs and line endings when needed (it will insert spaces when necessary).

Currently, the following shortcuts are used:
1) <Ctrl><Shift><C>: Enter multi edit mode
    1) <Ctrl><Home>: At edit points at the beginning of each line in the 
                     selection and put the cursor on the line before the first
                     line in the selection
    2) <Ctrl><End>:  The reverse of <Ctrl><Home>, add edit points at the end
                     of the lines in the selection.
    3) <Ctrl><E>:    Toggle edit point at cursor position
    4) <Enter>:      When there is a selection spanning multiple lines, will
                     convert this selection to a column selection. You can
                     create an 'empty' column selection (one single column) or
                     the selection can span multiple columns. You can copy and
                     cut this selection as well as delete it. Upon deletion
                     (or first insertion), the text in the selection will be
                     deleted and the column on edit points will be created
                     at the column. Tab to space conversions only happen when
                     entering actual edit mode.
    
2) <Escape>:
    1) Removes edit points when multiple edit points are active
    2) Removes column selection when there is a column selection
    3) Exits multi edit mode

Care has been taken to preserve the undo stack. Although it could be a bit nicer
in some cases, this would probably need some changes in the undo manager of 
GtkSourceView.
